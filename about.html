            <p id="myinfo">“There is no difference between day and night except for a generalized observation. The sight of the sun tells us that it is daytime, but the sun is always in the sky, and without it, there is no light bright enough to tell us that we are in darkness. Because of the darkness, even the smallest object in that void becomes important to us. We feel comfortable under an enclosed space, similar to the void in our lives, but we start to worry when there is nowhere left for us to run away from the dark, even though all there is in the world is that darkness itself.”</p>
